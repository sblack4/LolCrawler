Get data from the Riot API and put it into a SQLLite database

**WIP**

## Idea 
We have a SQLLite Database and this app to 
1. get a random player from the database we haven't done yet
1. get all their matches we haven't covered yet
1. get all the information for that match & insert into database
1. get all the timeline data for that match & insert into database
1. mark that player covered and start again from one

The default seed player is set to [Faker](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Faker)
